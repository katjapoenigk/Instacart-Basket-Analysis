# Instacart_OnlineGrocery_2017_Analysis

## Background
- Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. It already has good sales, but the management wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns.
- This project was created for my Data Analytics bootcamp studies at CareerFoundry in 2023.

## Data
- 7 CSV files
- 34 columns in total
- Data Dictionary is provided by [jeremystan](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b).

The dataset comprises of information on the following parameters:
* Orders
* Products
* Departments
* Aisles
* Customers
###### Note: The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 was accessed via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis). The customer data as well as the “prices” column in the products data set were both fabricated by CareerFoundry for the learning purpose of this course.
